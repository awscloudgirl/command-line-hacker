# Chapter 15: Exercises

## Exercise 1: Exploring the Linux Kernel

- **Objective**: Understand the role and components of the Linux kernel.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Use `uname -r` to display the current kernel version.
  2. Explore the `/boot` directory to identify kernel-related files.
  3. Research the features and improvements introduced in the current kernel version.

## Exercise 2: Configuring and Compiling the Kernel

- **Objective**: Practice configuring and compiling the Linux kernel.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Download the latest stable kernel source from the official website.
  2. Configure the kernel using `make menuconfig` or a similar tool.
  3. Compile the kernel and install it, then reboot to use the new kernel.

## Exercise 3: Managing Kernel Modules

- **Objective**: Learn to manage kernel modules dynamically.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Use `lsmod` to list all currently loaded kernel modules.
  2. Load a specific module using `modprobe` and verify its presence with `lsmod`.
  3. Unload the module using `rmmod` and confirm it is no longer loaded.

## Exercise 4: Updating and Patching the Kernel

- **Objective**: Update and patch the Linux kernel.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Check for available kernel updates using your distribution's package manager.
  2. Apply a kernel patch to address a specific issue or vulnerability.
  3. Verify that the patch has been applied successfully and test system stability.

## Exercise 5: Troubleshooting Kernel Issues

- **Objective**: Diagnose and resolve common kernel-related issues.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Identify and resolve a hardware compatibility issue using kernel modules.
  2. Use kernel logs to troubleshoot a system crash or performance problem.
  3. Document the troubleshooting process and solutions for future reference.
