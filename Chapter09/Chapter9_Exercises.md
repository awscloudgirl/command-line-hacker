# Chapter 9: Exercises

## Exercise 1: Compressing and Decompressing Files

- **Objective**: Practice using compression tools.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Use `gzip` to compress a text file and then decompress it.
  2. Compress a file using `bzip2` and verify the compression ratio.
  3. Experiment with `xz` to compress and decompress a file.

## Exercise 2: Archiving with tar

- **Objective**: Learn to create and manipulate tar archives.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Use `tar` to create an archive of a directory and list its contents.
  2. Extract the contents of a tar archive to a specified directory.
  3. Create a compressed tarball using `tar` and `gzip`.

## Exercise 3: Combining Compression and Archiving

- **Objective**: Combine compression and archiving techniques.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Create a `.tar.gz` archive of multiple files and verify its size.
  2. Create a `.tar.bz2` archive and compare its compression ratio with `.tar.gz`.
  3. Extract files from a compressed tarball and verify their integrity.

## Exercise 4: Verifying File Integrity

- **Objective**: Ensure the integrity of compressed and archived files.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Generate a checksum for a compressed file using `md5sum` or `sha256sum`.
  2. Verify the checksum to ensure the file's integrity after transfer.
  3. Experiment with different checksum algorithms and compare their outputs.

## Exercise 5: Using Advanced Compression Tools

- **Objective**: Explore advanced compression tools.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Use `zip` to create a ZIP archive of a directory and list its contents.
  2. Extract files from a ZIP archive using `unzip`.
  3. Compare the features and performance of `zip` with other compression tools.
