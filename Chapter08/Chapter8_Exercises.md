# Chapter 8: Exercises

## Exercise 1: Creating and Executing Scripts

- **Objective**: Practice creating and running Bash scripts.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Create a simple Bash script that prints "Hello, Bash!" to the terminal.
  2. Make the script executable using `chmod` and run it from the command line.
  3. Modify the script to accept a command-line argument and print a personalized greeting.

## Exercise 2: Using Variables and Data Types

- **Objective**: Learn to define and manipulate variables in scripts.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Create a script that defines a variable and prints its value.
  2. Modify the script to perform arithmetic operations on numeric variables.
  3. Experiment with string manipulation using variables.

## Exercise 3: Implementing Control Structures

- **Objective**: Use control structures to enhance script functionality.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Write a script that uses an `if` statement to check if a file exists and prints a message.
  2. Create a `for` loop that iterates over a list of files and prints their names.
  3. Implement a `while` loop that counts down from 10 to 1 and prints each number.

## Exercise 4: Defining and Using Functions

- **Objective**: Organize scripts using functions.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Define a function within a script that prints a welcome message.
  2. Call the function multiple times from the main script.
  3. Modify the function to accept parameters and print a customized message.

## Exercise 5: Debugging Scripts

- **Objective**: Practice debugging techniques for Bash scripts.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Introduce an error into a script and use `set -x` to trace its execution.
  2. Use `set -e` to stop the script on errors and observe the behavior.
  3. Correct the error and verify that the script runs successfully.
