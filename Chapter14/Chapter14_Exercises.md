# Chapter 14: Exercises

## Exercise 1: Configuring Wireless Networks

- **Objective**: Practice configuring wireless network connections.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Use `iwconfig` to view the current wireless network configuration.
  2. Connect to a wireless network using `nmcli` and verify the connection.
  3. Experiment with different network settings and observe the changes.

## Exercise 2: Capturing and Analyzing Wireless Traffic

- **Objective**: Use tools to capture and analyze wireless network traffic.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Use `tcpdump` to capture wireless packets and save them to a file.
  2. Open the capture file in `Wireshark` and analyze the traffic.
  3. Identify any unusual or suspicious activity in the captured data.

## Exercise 3: Securing Wireless Networks

- **Objective**: Implement security measures for wireless networks.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Configure a wireless network to use WPA2 encryption and verify the settings.
  2. Change the network to use WPA3 encryption (if supported) and test connectivity.
  3. Review and apply best practices for securing wireless networks.

## Exercise 4: Scanning and Monitoring Wireless Networks

- **Objective**: Use tools to scan and monitor wireless networks.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Use `aircrack-ng` to scan for available wireless networks and list their details.
  2. Monitor a specific network for unauthorized devices or activity.
  3. Create a report summarizing the findings from the network scan.

## Exercise 5: Troubleshooting Wireless Network Issues

- **Objective**: Diagnose and resolve common wireless network issues.
- **Tasks**:
