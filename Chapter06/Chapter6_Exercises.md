# Chapter 6: Exercises

## Exercise 1: Monitoring Processes

- **Objective**: Practice monitoring system processes.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Use the `ps` command to list all currently running processes.
  2. Use `top` to monitor real-time system performance and process activity.
  3. Explore `htop` for an enhanced interactive process viewer (if installed).

## Exercise 2: Managing Processes

- **Objective**: Learn to manage and control processes.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Start a long-running process in the terminal and use `Ctrl+Z` to suspend it.
  2. Use `bg` to resume the process in the background.
  3. Use `kill` to terminate the process and verify its termination with `ps`.

## Exercise 3: Adjusting Process Priorities

- **Objective**: Practice adjusting process priorities.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Start a process with a lower priority using `nice`.
  2. Use `renice` to change the priority of an existing process.
  3. Observe the impact of priority changes on process performance using `top`.

## Exercise 4: Background and Foreground Processes

- **Objective**: Manage background and foreground processes.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Start a process in the background using `&` and verify it with `jobs`.
  2. Bring the background process to the foreground using `fg`.
  3. Experiment with stopping and restarting processes using `Ctrl+Z`, `bg`, and `fg`.
